# BubbleSort
Implementation of [bubble sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) in Visual Basic.NET

I add four forms of implementation this algorithm.

1. With checking the index of the array.
2. Without checking the index of the array.
3. With *While* statement.
4. Using [Array.Sort](https://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/6tf1f0bc(v=vs.110).aspx) method of .NET Framework.

This is a console application, just clone or download and them execute in Visual Studio. (I recommended Visual Studio Community Edition).

The code of the implementation is in the *Module1.vb* file.

If you have some problem please create an issue ticket or contact me to help you.
